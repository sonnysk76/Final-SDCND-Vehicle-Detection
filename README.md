#Vehicle Detection and Tracking
Vehicle Detection Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

- Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
- Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.
- Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
- Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
- Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
- Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## Writeup / Read Me

### CRITERIA
#### Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. Here is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.
_This document aims to meet this specification._

## Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

### CRITERIA
#### Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

TODO:

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

TODO:

## Sliding Window Search

### CRITERIA
#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search. How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?
TODO:

#### Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working. How did you optimize the performance of your classifier?
TODO:

## Video Implementation

### CRITERIA
#### Provide a link to your final video output. Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
TODO:

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.
TODO:

## Discussion
### CRITERIA

#### Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project. Where will your pipeline likely fail? What could you do to make it more robust?
